To run example correctly you MUST use the following Java agent:

-javaagent:../org.apache.commons.javaflow.tools.cdi-javaagent/target/CdiProxyInstrumentationAgent.jar

It instruments OpenWebBeans generated proxies to work correctly with continuations!
First (by order) agent (-javaagent:../org.apache.commons.javaflow.tools.javaagent/target/JavaFlowInstrumentationAgent.jar ) is only necessary if you are using Java 8 lambdas, or instrument classes at run-time
